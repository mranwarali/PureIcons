// This file previously contained custom icon definitions.
// All icons are now sourced from 'feather-icons-react'.
// This file can remain empty or be removed if no other custom exports are needed.
// For now, we keep it minimal to avoid breaking existing imports that might still reference it.
// Any component still importing from here will need to be updated.

// Example of how you would re-export if you wanted a single entry point for Feather icons:
// export { default as Home } from 'feather-icons-react/build/Home';
// However, for simplicity, we will update components to import directly from 'feather-icons-react'.
